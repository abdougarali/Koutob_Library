# How to Get Your Brevo List ID - Step by Step

## ✅ What You DON'T Need to Configure (For Now)

You're seeing these options in Brevo:
- ❌ **Attributs des contacts** (Contact Attributes) - Not needed now
- ❌ **Attributs des entreprises** (Company Attributes) - Not needed now
- ❌ **Webhooks** - Not needed now
- ❌ **Contacts non engagés** (Unengaged Contacts) - Not needed now
- ❌ **Ouvertures Apple MPP** - Not needed now

**You can skip all of these for Phase B!**

## ✅ What You DO Need: List ID

### Step 1: Go to Lists (Not Settings)

1. In Brevo dashboard, click on **"Contacts"** in the left sidebar
2. Click on **"Lists"** (NOT "Settings" or "Contact Attributes")
3. You should see a page with your contact lists

### Step 2: Create a List (If You Don't Have One)

1. Click **"Create a list"** button (or "Créer une liste")
2. Enter a name: **"Newsletter Subscribers"** (or any name you prefer)
3. Click **"Create"** (or "Créer")

### Step 3: Get the List ID

1. After creating/selecting a list, look at the **URL in your browser**
2. The URL will look like:
   ```
   https://app.brevo.com/contacts/list/2
   ```
3. The number at the end (`2`) is your **List ID**
4. **Copy this number** - you'll need it!
